<h1>Simple JavaScript Slider</h1>
Optimized, responsive, easy to use slider made in JavaScript. Without jQuery!

In order to use it in your project, you just need to insert the necessary selector from your HTML markup into the script when declared a variable here:


```javascript
let slideIndex = 1,                                     //Active slide
    slides = document.querySelectorAll('.slider-item'), //Arr with Slides blocks
    prev = document.querySelector('.prev'),             //Previous arrow
    next = document.querySelector('.next'),             //Next arrow
    dotsWrap = document.querySelector('.slider-dots'),  //Wrap for dots
    dots = document.querySelectorAll('.dot');           //Array with Dots
```  

    
Also you can just copy my HTML and paste to your markup in order for the script to work exactly.
